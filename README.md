# fp-multiplier

A pipelined IEEE-754 single-precision floating-point multiplier implemented in SystemVerilog.  
Includes normalization, rounding, exception handling, full testbench, and SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for formal verification.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a custom hardware multiplier for IEEE-754 single-precision floating-point numbers.  
The design is pipelined for performance and thoroughly verified through testbenches and assertions.

Developed as part of the **Low-Level Digital HW Systems II** course at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (AUTH), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.
